# project

In lieu of a final, we will be doing a final project.  The goal of the final project is to give you a forum for exploring a topic that you're interested in.

See the included project outline file for additional details.

Dates for the project (due at 9:30 am on the stated date):

Date     | Deliverable
---------|--------
March 29 | Tell me your group members, topic of interest, write up a paragraph giving a very brief overview of the topic and why you are interested in it
April 12 | Write down an itemized list of what you plan on doing for the project (such as examining a method via simulation, analyzing a particular data set, describing how/why a method works, ...).  Be specific about each of these items.  Your goal is to convince me that you've thought through what you are planning on doing
April 26 | Submit a progress report of your write-up.  It can have as many figures/tables as you need, but can be no more than 500 words.
May 10 | Submit a final version of your write-up.  It can have as many figures/tables as you need, but can be no more than 1000 words.
